## Machine learning project with using CNN  
The aim of this project is to train a model that detects the disease in the given leaf image of a rice plant. 
Trained on the [Plant village dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08060).  
This dataset contains images from various species of plants with and without disease (healthy).  
VGG 16 model has been trained on the rice images in this dataset 
because rice is the staple crop in india and selecting a single 
plant type will decrease the training cost.
